# 🧫 Antibiotic Resistance Study

This repository contains R scripts and data used to analyze the **zone of inhibition** of different antibiotics against bacterial isolates.  
The study applies statistical and graphical techniques (ANOVA, interaction plots, and faceted ggplot visualizations) to explore antibiotic effectiveness.
## 📊 Visualizations

1️⃣ **Interaction Plot** – Displays the mean inhibition zone for each antibiotic across isolates.  
2️⃣ **Grouped Bar Plot with Error Bars** – Compares mean inhibition zones with standard error.  
3️⃣ **Jittered Scatter Plot** – Shows individual data points with mean summaries.  
4️⃣ **Faceted Grouped Bar Chart** – Displays mean inhibition zones per isolate in separate panels.  
5️⃣ **Faceted Bar + Jitter Plot** – Combines raw data distribution and mean summaries.  
6️⃣ **Faceted Violin + Boxplot** – Shows the full distribution and summary statistics for each antibiotic.  
7️⃣ **Faceted Comparative Boxplot** – Provides a clean comparison of inhibition zones across antibiotics for each isolate.
